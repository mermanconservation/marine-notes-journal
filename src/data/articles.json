      "abstract": "During 2025, the Iberian killer whale (Orcinus orca) population exhibited an ongoing pattern of interactions with sailing boats, mainly along the Portuguese Atlantic coast and Strait of Gibraltar. This report provides an updated overview of incidents recorded from January to October 2025, analysing their geographic distribution, frequency, and behavioural characteristics. The study explores possible motivations, cultural transmission, and management strategies for both conservationists and mariners.",
